        <h2>About BloodConnect</h2>
        <p>
            BloodConnect is a platform designed to bring together <b>donors, acceptors, 
            and administrators</b> for quick, safe, and reliable blood management.  
            Our mission is to make blood donation and transfusion <b>easier, faster, and more accessible</b> to everyone in need.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            We aim to save lives by building a strong network of voluntary blood donors.  
            With real-time updates and simple registration, BloodConnect ensures that blood is available 
            whenever and wherever it is needed.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Why Donate Blood?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Every 2 seconds, someone in the world needs blood.</li>
            <li>One donation can save up to <b>3 lives</b>.</li>
            <li>Blood cannot be manufactured—it can only come from donors like you.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
            1. Donors can register and update their availability. <br />
            2. Acceptors can quickly find nearby donors. <br />
            3. Administrators ensure smooth and safe operations.
