        <h1>Why Donate Blood?</h1>
        <p>Donating blood saves lives by providing a critical resource for accident victims, surgery patients, individuals with chronic illnesses like cancer and anemia, and those with bleeding disorders. Your single donation can help up to three people when separated into components like red cells, platelets, and plasma, each serving different medical needs. Regular blood donation from healthy individuals is crucial to maintain a stable blood supply because blood can only be stored for a limited time.</p>

        <h2>Why Blood Donation is Crucial</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saves lives:</strong> Blood is needed for patients undergoing surgeries, recovering from accidents, or dealing with illnesses such as cancer, anemia, and hemophilia.</li>
            <li><strong>No substitute:</strong> There is no manufactured alternative for blood; donors provide the only source of this life-saving substance.</li>
            <li><strong>Supports various conditions:</strong> Vital for treating women during childbirth complications, children with severe anemia, and patients requiring blood product transfusions.</li>
            <li><strong>Component therapy:</strong> A single donation can be separated into red blood cells, plasma, and platelets, each used to treat different patient groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Constant demand:</strong> The need for blood is continuous and universal, with about 8 in 10 people needing blood or blood products at some point in their lives.</li>
            <li><strong>Community impact:</strong> Regular donations help ensure a consistent and safe supply of blood is available whenever and wherever it's needed.</li>
        </ul>
